Welcome to our version of Picross. 

inorder to host this website you must do several things:
1) make the project the home directory of the server (I.E. xampp).
2) once that is done, you must go into localhost/phpmyadmin and create a new user with the following credentials:
        username: csci130
        password: 123456
        host: local
3) then execute createDB and table files by typing "localhost/php/createDB.php" and "localhost/php/table.php" into the URL... in that order.

note: if you wish to not log in to test the game, comment out lines 4-7 in index.php.

we hope you enjoy our website.

P.S. someone hire us please.
